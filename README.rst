pkgcore
=======

pkgcore is a framework for package management; via the appropriate class
plugins, the design should allow for any underlying repository/config/format to
be used; slackware's tgzs being exempted due to lack of any real metadata, and
autopackage format being exempted due to the fact they effectively embed the
manager in each package (pkgcore *does* require being able to treat the pkg as
data, instead of autopackage's method of handing resolution/all manager ops off
to the package script).

Tools
=====

**pclean**: clean distfiles, binpkgs, and builds dirs

**pclonecache**: clone a repository cache

**pconfig**: query configuration info

**pebuild**: low-level ebuild operations, go through phases manually

**pinspect**: inspect repository related info

**pmaint**: repository maintenance (syncing, copying...)

**pmerge**: dependency resolution, fetching, (un)merging, etc.

**pquery**: query repository info, revdeps, pkg search, vdb search, etc.

Requirements
============

At least python version 3.10, and snakeoil_ â€” a utility library split out of
pkgcore for others to use.

Installing
==========

Installing latest pypi release::

    pip install pkgcore

Installing from git::

    pip install https://github.com/pkgcore/pkgcore/archive/master.tar.gz

Installing from a tarball::

    pip install .

Developing
==========

Installing the dependencies for testing, formatting, and documentation building
into an editable environment::

    make dev-environment

Tests
=====

Standard python test runners can be used, for example:

    pytest -v

A tox config is provided so the testsuite can be run in a
virtualenv setup against all supported python versions. To run tests for all
environments just execute **tox** in the root directory of a repo or unpacked
tarball. Otherwise, for a specific python version execute something similar to
the following::

    tox -e py311
